# SELF-NOTES

## .env files

- Always read proper documentation to ensure the correct naming convention of the environment variables.
- ENV_VARIABLE_NAME = "environment variable" and ENV_VARIABLE_NAME = environment-variable . Both are the same. Production grade applications use string notation only.
- Always restart the server after making any changes in environment variables.
- We can name environment variables in uppercase (preferred) or lowercase.
